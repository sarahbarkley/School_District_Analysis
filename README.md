## School District Analysis Summary

Changing the Thomas High School 9th Grader Scores to NaN affected many of our conclusions that we found in the original analysis. Originally medium schools were found to be the
most successful school size, but after our changes this is the small school size. Additionally Thomas High School dropped six places in the top schools list. Thomas High School
passing percentages dropped by ~30% in each subject and overall. However, we found that this did not greatly affect our overall passing percentages which only varied by about 
1%.
